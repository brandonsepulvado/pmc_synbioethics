{"article_title": "Alignment-Free Analyses of Nucleic Acid Sequences Using Graphical Representation (with Special Reference to Pandemic Bird Flu and Swine Flu)", "abstract": " The exponential growth in database of bio-molecular sequences have spawned many approaches towards storage, retrieval, classification and analyses requirements. Alignment-free techniques such as graphical representations and numerical characterisation (GRANCH) methods have enabled some detailed analyses of large sequences and found a number of different applications in the eukaryotic and prokaryotic domain. In particular, recalling the history of pandemic influenza in brief, we have followed the progress of viral infections such as bird flu of 1997 onwards and determined that the virus can spread conserved over space and time, that influenza virus can undergo fairly conspicuous recombination-like events in segmented genes, that certain segments of the neuraminidase and hemagglutinin surface proteins remain conserved and can be targeted for peptide vaccines. We recount in some detail a few of the representative GRANCH techniques to provide a glimpse of how these methods are used in formulating quantitative sequence descriptors to analyse DNA, RNA and protein sequences to derive meaningful results. Finally, we survey the surveillance techniques with a special reference to how the GRANCH techniques can be used for the purpose and recount the forecasts made of possible metamorphosis of pandemic bird flu to pandemic human infecting agents.

These tasks require methods to characterise the information contained in these sequences with a view to compare and contrast different sequences to determine their functions and place in the biological domain. The symbolic DNA sequence representation has been the legacy mainstay of such analyses carried over from the oligonucleotide sequence days, falling far short of the requirements of the broad sweeping overview of local and global base distributions, multiple sequence similarities and dissimilarities, molecular evolution and other studies necessary for an overarching assessment of the relationship of any DNA/RNA sequence to the biome through the accumulated data in the nucleic acid databases.\n      "}, {"section": "Introduction", "text": "Sequence alignment has been the primary tool of choice for such comparison of generic sequences. However, in the conventional methods, the time complexity of sequence alignment varies as ~O(l\n) for two sequence segments of length l (Kobori and Mizuta 2015). In the realm of genomic sequences, this clearly consumes an enormous amount of computation time, which grows even worse when multiple alignments are necessary. The reason behind such sequence alignment is the fact that mutational changes in nucleic acid sequences through individual nucleotide mutations and rearrangements in nucleotide distributions brought on by various biological processes are reflected in the DNA/RNA sequences we observe today. This constitutes one of the main considerations facing biologists trying to understand the variations between different sequences of the same genera and their evolution (Qi et al. 2011).\n      "}, {"section": "Introduction", "text": "Numerical characterisation of the DNA/RNA sequences is one of the main tools in undertaking this task, and a number of methods were developed to analyse specific attributes of DNA sequences. For example, the dot plot (Gibbs and McIntyre 1970) is used to visualise identical sequence segments between two proteins by the diagonal runs in a matrix of the constituents of the two sequences. Needleman and Wunsch (1970) used dynamic programming techniques to align protein or nucleotide sequences; another dynamic programming scheme was later proposed by Smith and Waterman (1981) (Smith et al. 1985), for improved scoring local sequence alignment, but the computational complexity and time requirements have limited its use. For protein secondary structure prediction, Chou and Fasman (1974a, b) developed an empirical technique, which, however, has been superseded by new machine learning techniques. In particular, dynamic programming techniques that analyse DNA sequences in terms of discrete small segments to eventually merge into the full sequence require time commitments of ~O(l\n), where k is the number of sequences to be aligned and is expensive in the use of computing resources, whereas fast Fourier transform (FFT) requiring resource time of ~O(l log l) is only slightly better (Hanson, thesis 2003). Multiple alignment fast Fourier transform (MAFFT) with a simplified scoring system to reduce the computational overhead (Katoh et al. 2002), discrete Fourier transforms (Yin et al. 2014) and wavelet transforms (Dodin et al. 2000) that displays regularity in patterns in DNA sequences have been some of the other methods deployed to extraction of information of interest from the DNA databanks. BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) is one of the most popular search tools for local alignments; it uses a heuristic algorithm that takes shortcuts to identify, very rapidly, sequences in a library that most closely resemble the query sequence (Altschul et al. 1990, 1997).\n      "}, {"section": "Introduction", "text": "A more general approach that permits local and global sequence comparisons, generation of phylogenetic trees, numerical characterisations of DNA/RNA/protein sequences, quantitative estimation of sequence divergences and other properties and rational design of peptide vaccines is offered by novel, alignment-free schemes of graphical representation and numerical characterisation of biomolecular sequences (see review Nandy et al. 2006). The basic procedure in all these methods is to identify a vector with each type of nucleotide and plot each vector successively until the end of the sequence, thus drawing out a trajectory in the space of the model; associating a numerical value with the curve results in a descriptor of the sequence. This allows for quantitative comparisons between sequences and forms a powerful tool for analysis of similarities and dissimilarities between genes on a local and global scale. These novel approaches dispense with the need for alignments, which, for large sequences, become less reliable due to divergence of species and subsequent rearrangements (e.g. reversal, transposition or block exchange) occurring over evolutionary time scales; corrections introduced to take care of these divergences depend upon significant homologies between the sequences and the genes to be compared and thus become restrictive (Qi et al. 2011).\n      "}, {"section": "Introduction", "text": "However, as we discuss later, these alignment-free graphical representation methods are not without their problems either. One of these is related to computation of the sequence descriptors.

Extensions of these approaches have been made to take into account protein sequences (see review Randic et al. 2011) where the problem is compounded by the fact that the basic building blocks in protein sequences are constituted by 20 amino acids (Nandy et al. 2009) in comparison to nucleotide sequences where the basic building blocks constitute four bases; in terms of the methodologies, we consider a few in a short section and refer the readers to the original papers for greater details.\n      "}, {"section": "Introduction", "text": "These graphical representation methods are found ready for acceptance in research.

We proceeded to simplify the representation intuitively by projecting the primary sequence in a 20-dimensional Euclidean space which can be used to understand the phylogenetic relationship, provide mutational insight and identify conserved regions for groups of proteins.

It is interesting to note that post first infection wave, herd immunity within the population should have immunologically protected a second wave of infection in the same year. But on the contrary, the second wave drastically increased mortality rates. A key enigma, genetically, is the occurrence of the three infection waves in rapid succession within a period of 6\u201312\u00a0months: the H1N1 virus had to accumulate immense mutational changes or acquire key genetic alterations for it to become so fatal so rapidly which normally requires years of circulation within a population.

Towards the end of the century, in 1996, H5N1 virus was identified in China in geese which subsequently jumped the species barrier to infect poultry; some humans were incidentally infected in the 1997 wave and caused serious concern of another pandemic (De Jong et al. 1997).

In China and the Far East, where poultry and swine herds are raised in numerous villages and farms, avian influenza with \u03b1-2-3-linked sialic acid receptors can infect swine and develop the ability to bind \u03b1-2-6-linked sialic acid receptors. This enables the modified virus to infect humans in the upper respiratory tract and make transmission between humans easy through sneezing and coughing. The scare with the bird flu, H5N1, was for this particular possibility \u2013 the virus has a high mortality ratio but to date can infect humans only through the \u03b1-2-3-linked sialic acid receptors.

One strain was capable of binding \u03b1-2-6-linked sialic acid receptors present in the upper respiratory tract, having mutations at amino acid positions 190 (E190D) and 225 (D225G) in the HA1 segment (Reid et al. 2003).

The enzyme required for influenza gene replication in the host cell, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, is devoid of any proofreading activity, which allows mutations during replication to be retained. Mutational changes in IAV are known to proceed by two well-documented mechanisms, antigenic drift and antigenic shift (CDC 2017b). Antigenic drifts arise out of random point mutations. If they occur in the viral antigenic site, the host cell may lose immunity against the virus, and the infection-immunity response cycle starts all over again. These drifts can cause seasonal outbreaks or epidemics, but they are not potent enough to give rise to pandemics. Antigenic shifts are less recurrent, occurring only when two or more virus subtypes infect a host cell. As the virus has segmented genome, the progeny virus may pack genes from different subtypes in a process known as reassortment. This may give rise to new and unique subtypes, sometimes introducing novel surface-exposed HA or NA that may predispose the viral host to high degree of pathogenesis. Antigenic shifts are often the causes of pandemics.\n        "}, {"section": "Genetics of Influenza Virus", "text": "Interestingly, the Spanish flu virus is believed to have had greater than expected number of silent nucleotide or synonymous mutations (mutations that do not change the corresponding amino acids) in its genome in comparison with its avian and mammalian counterparts (Morens et al. 2010) and caused other pandemics through reassortments: the H2N2 pandemic of 1957, the H3N2 pandemic of 1968 and the H1N1 pandemic of 2009. The H5N1 bird flu is believed to have been a reassortment of genes from a prior H5N1 and a H9N2. Similarly, the H7N9 avian flu that struck China in 2013 (Gao et al. 2013) was a reassorted virus, picking up genes from multiple hosts like HA genes from H7N3 virus of domestic duck, NA from H7N9 virus of wild migratory birds and six other genes from the H9N2 virus of domestic poultry (CDC 2013; Liu et al. 2013). In 2015, there was an avian epidemic in the poultry market in the Midwest USA caused by H5N2 virus (Spackman et al. 2016), another product of reassortment which held possibilities of further reassortants.\n        "}, {"section": "Genetics of Influenza Virus", "text": "There is also a third mechanism by which a virus may mutate to form a new strain. If a host cell is coinfected by two different strains of the same subtypes, the RNA polymerase may jump during replication from one RNA segment to its counterpart on the other strain at a consensus sequence of the gene referred to as a break point, continue replication and then revert to the original strain at the next break point. This phenomenon is termed as copy-choice recombination. This can give rise to progeny virus having a novel RNA segment not present in either of the infecting strains. We have also considered the possibility of the natural division of distinct segments of a gene, such as HA1 and HA2 of HA as break points, a topic we discuss in some detail later. Recombination in viruses is a controversial subject where the incidence of recombination through copy-choice method is expected to be below 2% (Hao 2011; Boni et al. 2012).

Assuming that mutational changes in the sequences will be quantified by estimates of the graph radii, g\n, in a 2D graphical representation model (Nandy 1994), we assembled a database of 173 neuraminidase sequences for the years 1996\u20132005 and computed the average g\n values separately over periods when the flu was highly pathogenic to humans (1996\u20131997 and 2003\u20132005) and when less pathogenic (1998\u20132002). We found from computations of the g\n that, e.g. an H5N1 neuraminidase A/Chicken/Hong Kong/220/97(H5N1) had a very close similarity to another NA sequence from the same year, A/HongKong/156/97(H5N1), a result that matched with a conventional phylogenetic study by Suarez et al.

This provides a descriptor-based insight into how rapidly the virus mutates over the years. A more detailed analysis with the g\n of the individual segments showed that the g\n expanded in the years of high pathogenicity to humans, more so for the period 2003\u20132005, whereas the period of low pathogenicity showed reduced values of g\n.

We enquired into the possibility of another style of recombination, complete segments of a gene being exchanged through polymerase jumps at the segment boundaries: the neuraminidase gene with three segments \u2013 transmembrane, stalk and body \u2013 is a good example. Taking A/chicken/Afghanistan/1573\u201365/2006(H5N1)NA as a test case (Ghosh et al. 2009) and computing g\n values for the three segments individually, we compared each segment with corresponding segments of a selected group of H5N1 neuraminidase genes in terms of the g\n values. We found that the g\n value for the transmembrane segment of this strain was identical, for example, with the g\n value of the transmembrane segment of A/turkey/Islamabad/NARC7873/2007(H5N1)NA, i.e. they have the exact same sequence, implying a segment exchange had taken place at some time.

In this database we searched for sets of three strains where a HA1 from one strain and a HA2 from a different strain would combine to form a third, daughter strain (see schematic, Fig. 9.11). This was easily accomplished by computing g\n values for each segment for all the strains and comparing to find duplicates, with the proviso that the two parental strains were from the same time and place. We found a total of 73 daughter strains, but, interestingly, there were no exchanges between different subtypes of the hemagglutinin.

There was also an observation that the influenza over the years had shown only a few subtypes instead of large numbers possible from the existence of 18 HA and 11 NA subtypes. Clearly, there was some interdependence between the two proteins, but there was no idea of what and how strong the interdependence could be. We undertook a study through graphical representation method (Nandy et al. 2014) and hypothesised a coupling between the HA and NA nucleotide sequences which could be measured through the g\n values. We assumed that subtypes that exist would have strong coupling and subtypes that are not found in nature would be weakly coupled, i.e. their interdependence would be weak, and hence those strains would not survive in nature. Our results (Nandy et al. 2014) amply bore this out and in fact showed that the couplings were stronger for avian flus compared to human-infecting flus, which one would have expected since wild birds seem to be the reservoir of influenza viruses of different kinds.

The NSABB, National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity, allowed revised and heavily edited versions of the papers to be published in fear of dual-use research concerns (DURC) where scientific findings can be used for catastrophic implications. The NSABB, after much deliberation, recommended the full publication of their work.\n      "}, {"section": "Summary", "text": "In this chapter we have outlined powerful and novel alignment-free graphical representation and numerical characterisation (GRANCH) tools for comparative analyses of biomolecular sequences. We explained in brief some of the proposals put forward for graphical representation and numerical characterisation in various dimensionalities and mentioned some of the many applications done using these novel, alignment-free approaches. In particular, we concentrated upon several applications done through the simple and intuitive 2D graphical representation of Nandy (1994) to give an idea of how these approaches can be utilised to compare and contrast the several variants of the influenza virus, determine homologous recombinations between strains of the same influenza subtype, identify conserved segments in influenza gene sequences and design peptide vaccines. We have seen that these approaches can yield phylogenetic trees to understand the relationships between the various strains and subtypes and assist in focused surveillance to ensure advance knowledge of developments that could lead to epidemic and pandemic varieties. Graphical representation and numerical characterisation thus are very general but quantitative approaches that can be used to unravel myriad aspects of viral characteristics.\n    "}], "ref_list": [{"ref_id": "CR1", "pmid_cited": "19296677", "doi_cited": "", "ref_title": "Alignment-free prediction of polygalacturonases with pseudofolding topological indices: experimental isolation from coffea arabica and prediction of a new sequence", "ref_auth": "G Aguero-Chapin; J Varona-Santos; GA de la Riva; A Antunes; T Gonzalez-Villa; E Uriarte", "ref_year": "2009", "ref_jrnal": "J Proteome Res"}, {"ref_id": "CR2", "pmid_cited": "2231712", "doi_cited": "", "ref_title": "Basic local alignment search tool", "ref_auth": "SF Altschul; W Gish; W Miller; EW Myers; DJ Lipman", "ref_year": "1990", "ref_jrnal": "J Mol Biol"}, {"ref_id": "CR3", "pmid_cited": "9254694", "doi_cited": "", "ref_title": "Gapped BLAST and PSI-BLAST: a new generation of protein database search programs", "ref_auth": "SF Altschul; TL Madden; AA Schaffer; J Zhang; Z Zhang; W Miller; ", "ref_year": "1997", "ref_jrnal": "Nucleic Acids Res"}, {"ref_id": "CR02", "pmid_cited": "16494503", "doi_cited": "", "ref_title": "On Graphical and Numerical Representation of Protein Sequences", "ref_auth": "Fenglan Bai; Tianming Wang", "ref_year": "2006", "ref_jrnal": "Journal of Biomolecular Structure and Dynamics"}, {"ref_id": "CR4", "pmid_cited": "20335491", "doi_cited": "", "ref_title": "How RNA viruses maintain their genome integrity", "ref_auth": "JN Barr; R Fearns", "ref_year": "2010", "ref_jrnal": "J Gen Virol"}, {"ref_id": "CR5", "pmid_cited": "6282993", "doi_cited": "", "ref_title": "Survival of influenza viruses on environmental surfaces", "ref_auth": "B Bean; BM Moore; B Sterner; LR Peterson; DN Gerding; HH Balfour", "ref_year": "1982", "ref_jrnal": "J Infect Dis"}, {"ref_id": "CR7", "pmid_cited": "", "doi_cited": "10.1016/j.cplett.2007.05.050", "ref_title": "2D-dynamic representation of DNA sequences", "ref_auth": "D Bielinska-Waz; T Clark; P Waz; W Nowak; A Nandy", "ref_year": "2007", "ref_jrnal": "Chem Phys Lett"}, {"ref_id": "CR8", "pmid_cited": "22226809", "doi_cited": "", "ref_title": "No evidence for intrasegment recombination of 2009 H1N1 influenza virus in swine", "ref_auth": "MF Boni; GJ Smith; EC Holmes; D Vijaykrishna", "ref_year": "2012", "ref_jrnal": "Gene"}, {"ref_id": "CR9", "pmid_cited": "19230160", "doi_cited": "", "ref_title": "The biology of influenza viruses", "ref_auth": "Nicole M.
